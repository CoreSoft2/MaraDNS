To get MaraDNS' SQA regressions to work, MaraDNS needs to be compiled
with IPv6 support, as well as debugging symbols (Valgrind incorrectly reports
a leak when MaraDNS is compiled with '-O2').  

Some packages are needed to run the tests:

	yum -y install bind-utils
	yum -y install valgrind

Once we have these packages, from the maradns-2.0.XX directory:

	./configure --ipv6
	vi Makefile # Replace '-O2' with '-g'
	make
	cd sqa/regressions
	su
	sh ./do.tests 2> /dev/null

Have a cup of coffee or two while the tests are running; they can take a 
while.
